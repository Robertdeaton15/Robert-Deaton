### Information

If you are at this point (and the first to get here), we don't yet have the tooling released to automate this process. We need input from you before we make our internal tooling public for everyone to use.

Don't sweat it. We will work with you to get your plugin released. Drop us an email at opensource@disa.im and we'll guide you through the process. You'll only need to email us once - each update you do to your plugin you'll be able to package yourself. Your input on this process will enable us to get a better understanding for us to make this tooling publicly available.

## What will this tooling allow you to do?

This tooling allows you to completely automate the process - everything from packaging and signing your plugin with a certificate to deploying it on the cloud.

The tooling will enable developers to push a plugin updater easier than pushing an APK update to the play store (literally).

## Sharing Your Plugin

Post your plugin here when you want to let the world use it!
