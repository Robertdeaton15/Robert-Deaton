##Abstract
Plugin Manifests store the information associated with your plugin. Their file name has to be *PluginManifest.xml* and they have to reside in your project's assemblies directory.

##Creating the file
Right click on your plugin project in Xamarin Studio to unveil the contextual menu. Hover over 'Add' and choose 'New file...'.

On the left now choose 'XML' and name your file 'PluginManifest.xml'. Hit 'New' to finish.


##Filling in the information
Double click on your newly created `PluginManifest.xml` to reveal its contents (It should be blank right now! :smile:)
