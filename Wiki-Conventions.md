##Structure of a guide
A guide page should follow the following structure, which is already in use on some Wiki pages:  
The first segment of the page should be an "Abstract", which is a basic introduction to the guide.
All segment headers should be written in Markdown \#\#, which is the second Heading level.

![Example for an Abstract](http://s24.postimg.org/m9wdd5k2t/abstract_demo.png)

All other guide content should be organized in about 2 - 4 other segments, whose headings are also formatted with Markdown \#\#.

##Structure of the Wiki home page
The wiki home page should contain a basic overview of important topics covered in the Wiki. The upper part of this page should be especially oriented towards new developers to give them an easy start.

Wiki page links are organised into categories like "Your first Plugin" or "Disa concepts". Each link is accompanied by 1 or 2 lines of description about the linked page.

Below all this there must be a *skill level* (formatted in *italics*) which represents the complexity of the content. There are the following skill levels to choose from:  
- *BEGINNER LEVEL* - Understandable for absolute beginners to the Disa framework, but not for beginners to programming
- *INTERMEDIATE LEVEL* - Comprehensible for developers who have spent some time looking into the Disa framework  
- *PRO LEVEL* - Written for very experienced Disa developers, otherwise too complicated  
- *ANY LEVEL* - Understandable for everyone, even non-developers
